        question: "A nurse is caring for a client with chronic heart failure. Which finding would indicate that the client's condition is worsening?",
        options: [
            "Weight loss of 2 pounds over 3 days",
            "Decreased peripheral edema",
            "Weight gain of 3 pounds in 2 days",
            "Clear lung sounds"
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanations: [
            "Weight loss would indicate improvement in fluid retention, not worsening.",
            "Decreased peripheral edema indicates improvement in heart failure management.",
            "✅ CORRECT: Rapid weight gain (2-3 lbs in 24-48 hours) indicates fluid retention and worsening heart failure. This requires immediate intervention.",
            "Clear lung sounds indicate absence of pulmonary edema, which is a positive finding."
        ],
        rationale: "In heart failure, the heart's decreased pumping ability leads to fluid retention. Daily weights are the most sensitive indicator of fluid status changes. Rapid weight gain signals fluid accumulation before other symptoms appear.",

        question: "A client with COPD is experiencing an acute exacerbation. Which position would be most beneficial?",
        options: [
            "Supine with legs elevated",
            "Left side-lying",
            "High Fowler's position",
            "Trendelenburg position"
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanations: [
            "Supine position would worsen breathing difficulties in COPD exacerbation.",
            "Side-lying does not optimize lung expansion for COPD clients.",
            "✅ CORRECT: High Fowler's position (60-90 degrees upright) uses gravity to assist lung expansion and reduces work of breathing.",
            "Trendelenburg would severely compromise breathing in COPD."
        ],
        rationale: "High Fowler's position maximizes lung expansion by using gravity to lower the diaphragm and allows accessory muscles to work more effectively for breathing.",

        question: "A client is admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Which lab finding would the nurse expect?",
        options: [
            "Blood glucose 80 mg/dL",
            "pH 7.28",

            "Sodium 150 mEq/L"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanations: [
            "Blood glucose would be elevated (>250 mg/dL), not low.",
            "✅ CORRECT: DKA causes metabolic acidosis with pH <7.35. The body produces ketones when glucose cannot enter cells, creating acidosis.",
            "Potassium is typically low or normal initially due to insulin deficiency and diuresis.",
            "Sodium levels vary but are not the defining characteristic of DKA."
        ],
        rationale: "DKA occurs when insulin deficiency leads to fat breakdown for energy, producing ketones that cause metabolic acidosis. The classic triad is hyperglycemia, ketosis, and acidosis.",

        question: "A post-operative client develops a temperature of 101.5°F on the second day after surgery. What is the most likely cause?",
        options: [

        correct: 1,
        explanations: [
            "Wound infections typically occur 3-5 days post-operatively.",
            "✅ CORRECT: Atelectasis (collapsed alveoli) is the most common cause of fever in the first 48 hours after surgery due to shallow breathing and immobility.",
            "UTIs are more common after day 3 post-operatively.",
            "Medication reactions usually occur within hours of administration."
        ],
        rationale: "Post-operative patients often have shallow breathing due to pain and immobility, leading to collapsed alveoli (atelectasis) and fever. Early mobilization and deep breathing exercises help prevent this.",

        explanations: [
            "Protein may need to be restricted if hepatic encephalopathy is present.",
            "✅ CORRECT: Sodium restriction (2-4g daily) is essential in managing ascites as sodium retention contributes to fluid accumulation.",
            "Fluids may need to be restricted, not increased, in severe ascites.",
            "Carbohydrate restriction is not typically necessary for ascites management."
        ],
        rationale: "Ascites is caused by portal hypertension and decreased albumin production. Sodium restriction reduces fluid retention and accumulation in the peritoneal cavity.",

        question: "A client with a peptic ulcer asks what foods to avoid. Which response by the nurse is most appropriate?",
        options: [
            "Avoid all spicy foods and citrus fruits",
            "Eliminate coffee and alcohol completely",
            "Identify and avoid foods that cause you personal discomfort",
            "Follow a strict bland diet with no seasoning"
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanations: [
            "There's no evidence that spicy foods cause ulcers, though they may cause discomfort in some individuals.",
            "While alcohol should be limited, complete elimination of all caffeinated beverages isn't necessary for everyone.",
            "✅ CORRECT: Current evidence shows individual food tolerance varies. Patients should identify and avoid foods that personally cause discomfort.",
            "Bland diets are no longer routinely recommended for ulcer management."
        ],
        rationale: "Modern ulcer management focuses on H. pylori eradication and acid suppression rather than dietary restrictions. Individual tolerance guides food choices.",

        options: [
            "Restrict fluid intake to prevent fluid overload",
            "Encourage fluid intake of 2-3 liters daily unless contraindicated",

            "Keep the client in supine position"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanations: [
            "Restricting fluids would make secretions thicker and harder to expectorate.",
            "✅ CORRECT: Adequate hydration (2-3L daily unless contraindicated) helps thin secretions, making them easier to cough up and clear.",
            "Cough suppressants would prevent clearing of infected secretions.",
            "Upright positioning, not supine, facilitates drainage and coughing."

        explanations: [
            "Fasting is important but not the most critical aspect.",

            "Arrival time is important but not the most critical teaching point.",
            "While important due to sedation, bowel prep is the most critical for procedure success."

            "Green beans are generally acceptable for CKD patients."

        explanations: [
            "While fall prevention is important, this is not the primary rationale for bed rest in MI.",
            "✅ CORRECT: Bed rest reduces cardiac workload and myocardial oxygen demand, allowing the damaged heart muscle to heal and preventing further injury.",
            "While bed rest can increase clot risk, this is not the primary reason for prescribing it.",
            "Many MI patients do not have surgical incisions requiring healing."
        ],
        rationale: "After MI, the heart muscle is damaged and needs time to heal. Reducing activity decreases oxygen demand on the compromised myocardium.",

            "Ice chips can still pose aspiration risk in clients with dysphagia."

        explanations: [
            "Sodium doesn't directly damage blood vessels in the acute sense.",

            "Encourage frequent visitors to boost morale",

            "Visitors should be limited to reduce infection risk in neutropenic patients.",

        question: "A 6-month-old infant is admitted with bronchiolitis. Which intervention should the nurse prioritize?",
        options: [
            "Administering antibiotics as ordered",
            "Maintaining adequate hydration and monitoring respiratory status",
            "Teaching parents about medication administration",
            "Providing high-calorie formula"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanations: [
            "Bronchiolitis is typically viral, so antibiotics are not the primary treatment unless secondary bacterial infection occurs.",
            "✅ CORRECT: Bronchiolitis causes airway inflammation and increased mucus production. Priority is maintaining airway patency and adequate hydration. Monitor for respiratory distress.",
            "While parent education is important, it's not the immediate priority during acute illness.",
            "Nutrition is important but respiratory support and hydration take priority in acute bronchiolitis."
        ],
        rationale: "Bronchiolitis primarily affects the small airways in infants. The priority is always airway and breathing (ABC's). Maintaining hydration helps thin secretions, and close respiratory monitoring allows for early intervention if distress occurs.",

        question: "A 2-year-old child is hospitalized. Which approach would be most appropriate to minimize separation anxiety?",
        options: [
            "Encourage parents to visit only during designated hours",
            "Room the child with other children of the same age",
            "Allow parents to stay overnight and participate in care",
            "Assign the same nurse every day"
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanations: [
            "Restricted visiting would increase, not decrease, separation anxiety.",
            "Other children cannot replace the comfort provided by parents.",
            "✅ CORRECT: Allowing parents to stay and participate in care maintains the parent-child bond and reduces separation anxiety, which is most intense in toddlers.",
            "While consistent nursing is helpful, parental presence is most important."
        ],
        rationale: "Separation anxiety peaks in toddlers (12-36 months). Maintaining parental presence and involvement in care is the most effective way to reduce anxiety and promote coping.",

        question: "A 4-year-old child needs to receive an injection. Which approach would be most appropriate?",
        options: [
            "Tell the child it won't hurt at all",
            "Give the injection while the child is sleeping",
            "Explain the procedure using simple, honest language just before giving it",
            "Surprise the child to prevent anticipatory anxiety"
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanations: [
            "Telling a child it won't hurt is dishonest and damages trust.",
            "Giving injections during sleep can cause trauma and loss of trust.",
            "✅ CORRECT: Preschoolers need simple, honest explanations given just before procedures to minimize anticipatory anxiety while building trust.",
            "Surprising children can cause trauma and destroy trust in healthcare providers."
        ],
        rationale: "Preschoolers have active imaginations and limited understanding of time. Honest, simple explanations given just before procedures help build trust and reduce anxiety.",

        question: "An 8-year-old child with asthma is prescribed a metered-dose inhaler. What is the most important teaching point?",
        options: [
            "Inhale as fast and deeply as possible",
            "Use a spacer device with the inhaler",

            "Clean the inhaler monthly"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanations: [
            "Inhalation should be slow and deep, not fast.",
            "✅ CORRECT: Spacer devices are essential for children as they improve medication delivery to the lungs and reduce the need for coordinated timing.",
            "Children typically can't hold their breath for 30 seconds; 10 seconds is more appropriate.",
            "Inhalers should be cleaned weekly, not monthly."
        ],
        rationale: "Children often have difficulty coordinating inhaler activation with inhalation. Spacer devices eliminate the need for perfect timing and improve drug delivery to the airways.",

        question: "A 15-year-old adolescent is admitted with type 1 diabetes. Which approach would best promote adherence to the treatment regimen?",
        options: [
            "Have parents manage all aspects of diabetes care",
            "Provide detailed written instructions only",
            "Involve the adolescent in developing their care plan",

        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanations: [
            "Adolescents need to develop independence; parental control may lead to rebellion.",
            "Written instructions alone don't address the need for autonomy and involvement.",
            "✅ CORRECT: Adolescents need autonomy and control. Involving them in care planning promotes ownership and adherence to treatment.",
            "Fear-based education is often ineffective and may cause anxiety or denial."
        ],
        rationale: "Adolescents are developing independence and need to feel in control of their health decisions. Collaborative care planning promotes autonomy while ensuring proper management.",

        explanations: [
            "While nutrition is important, airway safety takes priority.",
            "Family support is important but not the priority during feeding.",
            "✅ CORRECT: Infants with cleft lip/palate have difficulty creating suction and are at high risk for aspiration. Airway protection is the priority.",
            "Bonding is important but safety comes first."
        ],
        rationale: "The cleft prevents proper seal during sucking, making it difficult to feed and increasing risk of aspiration pneumonia. Specialized feeding techniques are needed to ensure safe nutrition.",

        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanations: [
            "One week is too long for a 3-year-old's attention span and may increase anxiety.",
            "Medical terminology would confuse and frighten a preschooler.",
            "✅ CORRECT: Preschoolers learn best through play. Simple words and demonstration with familiar objects help them understand what to expect.",
            "Not discussing surgery can increase fear of the unknown."
        ],
        rationale: "Preschoolers have limited vocabulary and attention span but active imaginations. Play-based teaching using simple words and familiar objects helps them understand and cope with procedures.",

        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanations: [
            "Activity should be limited during pain crises to reduce oxygen demand.",
            "Cold can cause vasoconstriction and worsen sickling.",
            "✅ CORRECT: Prompt pain management is essential during sickle cell crises. Untreated pain can worsen sickling and complications.",
            "Fluid intake should be increased, not restricted, to help prevent sickling."
        ],
        rationale: "Sickle cell pain crises are caused by vaso-occlusion from sickled cells. Prompt, adequate pain management prevents further complications and improves outcomes.",

            "Pain that worsens with movement is typical of appendicitis.",
            "✅ CORRECT: Sudden relief of severe pain may indicate appendiceal rupture, which can lead to peritonitis and sepsis - a surgical emergency.",
            "Nausea and vomiting are common with appendicitis."
        ],
        rationale: "Sudden pain relief in appendicitis often indicates rupture, which releases infected contents into the peritoneum, causing life-threatening peritonitis.",

            "Honey should not be given to infants under 12 months due to botulism risk.",
            "✅ CORRECT: Single-ingredient foods like iron-fortified rice cereal allow identification of allergies and are easiest for infants to digest.",
            "Multiple new foods make it difficult to identify allergens or food intolerances.",
            "Solid foods should be introduced around 6 months to meet nutritional needs."
        ],
        rationale: "Single-ingredient foods introduced one at a time for 3-5 days allow parents to identify food allergies or intolerances while providing necessary nutrition as breast milk or formula alone becomes insufficient.",
